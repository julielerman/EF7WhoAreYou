if using package manager console, be sure I'm in the right directory:
   cd .\src\ASPNET5WebAPI (this is not the same as default project)
dnvm list
dnvm upgrade (this brought 1.0.0-beta8 onto my machine)
make sure entityframework.commands  is installed and in project.json (already ok in the webapi project)
make sure beta8 is the default with : dnvm use 1.0.0-beta8


dnx ef  (will list ef commands)
dnx ef [command] --help    (will list details of command)
ef database
	ef database update  [migration] -c [contextname]
ef dbcontext
    ef dbcontext list
	ef dbcontext scaffold
ef migrations

dnx ef migrations will list ef migraitons commands

Mucking with domain package json to resolve duplicate assembly problem with collecitons & threading 

Original:
 "dependencies": {
    "System.Collections": "4.0.10-beta-23019",
    "System.Linq": "4.0.0-beta-23019",
    "System.Threading": "4.0.10-beta-23019",
    "System.Runtime": "4.0.10-beta-23019",
    "Microsoft.CSharp": "4.0.0-beta-23019"
  },

  REMOVED collections, threading and csharp.
  Had to dnurestore first in the domain project and then in the web api project
