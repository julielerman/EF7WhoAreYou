if using package manager console, be sure I'm in the right directory:
   cd .\src\ASPNET5WebAPI (this is not the same as default project)
dnvm list
dnvm upgrade (this brought 1.0.0-beta8 onto my machine)
make sure entityframework.commands  is installed and in project.json (already ok in the webapi project)
make sure beta8 is the default with : dnvm use 1.0.0-beta8



Mucking with domain package json to resolve duplicate assembly problem with collecitons & threading 

Original:
 "dependencies": {
    "System.Collections": "4.0.10-beta-23019",
    "System.Linq": "4.0.0-beta-23019",
    "System.Threading": "4.0.10-beta-23019",
    "System.Runtime": "4.0.10-beta-23019",
    "Microsoft.CSharp": "4.0.0-beta-23019"
  },

  REMOVED collections, threading and csharp.
  Had to dnurestore first in the domain project and then in the web api project

  Installing the beta8 web tools made this problem disappear.

  note json options in startup to deal with circular refs when returning graphs
