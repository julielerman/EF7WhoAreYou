Demos and PowerPoints for Julie Lerman's "EF7: Who are you and what have you done to my ORM?" presentation.
This talk was given at Boston Code Camp (March 21, 2015), Techorama (May 2015) and DevSum15 (May 2015).

October 2015: Updated teh Familiar & enhancmenets solution to Beta 8. Removed Console App. Replaced with tests. This sollution using .NET 4.6, not ASP.NET 5.

See Readme.txt files in individual demo folders for details about each demo.

Please note! EF7 is really considered an Alpha at this point. EVERYTHING is subject to change. Keeping these demos working even from one "stable" beta (from nuget not from nightly builds) to another has been challenging so please keep that in mind. The goal of this session was to give you an idea of how things will be working not to teach you how to use EF7.

If you want to see these demos in action, check out my "Looking Ahead to Entity Framework 7" course on Pluralsight at bit.ly/PS-EF7Alpha.
